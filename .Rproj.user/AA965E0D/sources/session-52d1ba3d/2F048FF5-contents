### 2. Goal
The analysis aims to segment library users based on behavior and engagement while predicting customer lifetime value (CLV) to identify valuable user groups and guide strategies for retention and revenue growth.

<br>

### 3. Methodology

#### 3.1 Data Preparation:
  
  + Conducted data cleaning and preprocessing, including handling missing values, converting data types, and scaling numerical features.
  + Derived RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) features for clustering and engineered additional features, such as customer tenure and interaction metrics, for CLV prediction.

#### 3.2 Customer Segmentation:
  
  + Applied five clustering techniques: K-Means, DBSCAN, Agglomerative Clustering, GMM, and SOM.
  + Evaluated clustering performance using Silhouette Scores to identify the most effective method for segmenting customers based on RFM data.

#### 3.3 CLV Prediction:
  
  + Built predictive models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost, to estimate customer lifetime value.
  + Assessed model performance using RMSE and MAE, comparing linear and ensemble methods.

<br>

### 4. Summary
  + Segmentation: DBSCAN achieved the highest Silhouette Score (0.6249), effectively identifying dense clusters and handling noise, while K-Means and SOM showed moderate performance.
  + CLV Prediction: Linear Regression outperformed other models (RMSE: 0.0027, MAE: 0.0021), demonstrating the dataset's primarily linear nature. Random Forest also performed well, highlighting the value of ensemble models in capturing non-linear interactions.
  + Insights: Accurate segmentation and CLV prediction enable targeted customer engagement strategies, optimizing resource allocation and enhancing business outcomes.
